       <div class="info"> <h2>the NIV</h2>
        <p><img src="Bible.jpg" id="left" alt="Bible"/>Since the focus of this project is on the way that churches in the United States have
            interpreted the Bible, rather than on the Biblical text itself, the analysis was
            performed on an English translation, specifically the New International Version, because
            it is the version used as the basis of the interpretation in both the UMC and SBC
            commentaries, and it is widely considered to stay as true as possible to the original
            Greek text (Menzie). </p></div>
