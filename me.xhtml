      <h2>Your Researcher</h2>
 <p> <img id="left" alt="portrait" src="me.jpg" width="244.8" height="326.4"/>This website has been created by Alathia Joy Campbell under the guidance of Professor
            David J. Birnbaum as a summer undergraduate research project through the University of
            Pittsburgh Office of Undergraduate Research. Alathia is a senior at Pitt, majoring in
            Theatre Arts, minoring in Studio Arts, and getting a certificate in the Study of Women,
            Gender, and Sexuality. </p>
            
        <p> As this is a work of academic research, every effort has been made to keep it free of
            bias. However, when discussing issues of identity, it is impossible not to be informed
            on some level by oneâ€™s own identity. Thus, in the interest of full disclosure, your
            author is a white, non-Jewish, cisgendered, gay female from a middle class background,
            and her religious affiliation is to a mainline protestant denomination. </p>
