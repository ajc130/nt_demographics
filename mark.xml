            </story><v n="2"/>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them
        up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. <v
            n="3"/>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach
        them. <v n="4"/>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with
        Jesus. <v n="5"/>Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up
        three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." <v n="6"/>(He did not know
        what to say, they were so frightened.) <v n="7"/>Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them,
        and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" <v n="8"
        />Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. <v
            n="9"/>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone
        what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <v n="10"/>They kept the
        matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant. <v n="11"/>And they
        asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" <v n="12"
        />Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is
        it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? <v n="13"/>But I tell you,
        Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written
        about him." <v n="14"/>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around
        them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. <v n="15"/>As soon as all the people saw
        Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. <v n="16"/>"What are you
        arguing with them about?" he asked. <v n="17"/>A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I
        brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. <v n="18"
        />Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his
        teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could
        not." <v n="19"/>"O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you?
        How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me." <v n="20"/>So they brought him. When
        the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground
        and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. <v n="21"/>Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long
        has he been like this?" <v n="22"/>"From childhood," he answered. "It has often thrown him
        into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us." <v
            n="23"/>"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes." <v
            n="24"/>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my
        unbelief!" <v n="25"/>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the
        evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never
        enter him again." <v n="26"/>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The
        boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead." <v n="27"/>But Jesus took him
        by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. <v n="28"/>After Jesus had gone
        indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?" <v n="29"/>He
        replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer. " <v n="30"/>They left that place and
        passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, <v n="31"
        />because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be
        betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." <v
            n="32"/>But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
            <v n="33"/>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were
        you arguing about on the road?" <v n="34"/>But they kept quiet because on the way they had
        argued about who was the greatest. <v n="35"/>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and
        said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all." <v
            n="36"/>He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he
        said to them, <v n="37"/>"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my ref welcomes
        me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me." <v n="38"
        />"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your ref and we told him to
        stop, because he was not one of us." <v n="39"/>"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who
        does a miracle in my ref can in the next moment say anything bad about me, <v n="40"/>for
        whoever is not against us is for us. <v n="41"/>I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a
        cup of water in my ref because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward. <v
            n="42"/>"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it
        would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his
        neck. <v n="43"/>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter
        life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. <v n="44"
        />See Footnote <v n="45"/>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for
        you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. <v n="46"/>See
        Footnote <v n="47"/>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to
        enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, <v
            n="48"/>where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.' <v n="49"
        />Everyone will be salted with fire. <v n="50"/>"Salt is good, but if it loses its
        saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with
        each other." <c n="10"/>
        <v n="1"/>Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the
        Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <v n="2"
        />Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
        wife?" <v n="3"/>"What did Moses command you?" he replied. <v n="4"/>They said, "Moses
        permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away." <v n="5"/>"It was
        because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. <v n="6"/>"But
        at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <v n="7"/>'For this reason a
        man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <v n="8"/>and the two will
        become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <v n="9"/>Therefore what God has
        joined together, let man not separate." <v n="10"/>When they were in the house again, the
        disciples asked Jesus about this. <v n="11"/>He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and
        marries another woman commits adultery against her. <v n="12"/>And if she divorces her
        husband and marries another man, she commits adultery." <v n="13"/>People were bringing
        little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <v n="14"
        />When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to
        me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <v n="15"/>I
        tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will
        never enter it." <v n="16"/>And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and
        blessed them. <v n="17"/>As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his
        knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" <v
            n="18"/>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone. <v
            n="19"/>You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal,
        do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'" <v n="20"
        />"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy." <v n="21"/>Jesus looked
        at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give
        to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." <v n="22"/>At this
        the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <v n="23"/>Jesus looked
        around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
            <v n="24"/>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how
        hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <v n="25"/>It is easier for a camel to go through
        the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." <v n="26"/>The
        disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" <v n="27"
        />Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things
        are possible with God." <v n="28"/>Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow
        you!" <v n="29"/>"I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or
        brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <v
            n="30"/>will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes,
        brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age
        to come, eternal life. <v n="31"/>But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
            <v n="32"/>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the
        disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve
        aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <v n="33"/>"We are going up to
        Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers
        of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <v n="34"
        />who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
            <v n="35"/>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said,
        "we want you to do for us whatever we ask." <v n="36"/>"What do you want me to do for you?"
        he asked. <v n="37"/>They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your
        left in your glory." <v n="38"/>"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you
        drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" <v n="39"/>"We
        can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized
        with the baptism I am baptized with, <v n="40"/>but to sit at my right or left is not for me
        to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared." <v n="41"/>When
        the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <v n="42"/>Jesus called
        them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord
        it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <v n="43"/>Not so with
        you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <v n="44"/>and
        whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <v n="45"/>For even the Son of Man did not
        come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." <v n="46"/>Then
        they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving
        the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside
        begging. <v n="47"/>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus,
        Son of David, have mercy on me!" <v n="48"/>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but
        he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" <v n="49"/>Jesus stopped and
        said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling
        you." <v n="50"/>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <v
            n="51"/>"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said,
        "Rabbi, I want to see." <v n="52"/>"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you."
        Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road. <c n="11"/>
        <v n="1"/>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of
        Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, <v n="2"/>saying to them, "Go to the village ahead
        of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever
        ridden. Untie it and bring it here. <v n="3"/>If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?'
        tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'" <v n="4"/>They went and
        found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, <v n="5"/>some
        people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?" <v n="6"/>They
        answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. <v n="7"/>When they brought
        the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. <v n="8"/>Many people spread
        their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. <v n="9"
        />Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
        the xml:id of the Lord!" <v n="10"/>"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father
        David!Hosanna in the highest!" <v n="11"/>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He
        looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the
        Twelve. <v n="12"/>The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. <v n="13"
        />Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When
        he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. <v
            n="14"/>Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his
        disciples heard him say it. <v n="15"/>On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area
        and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of
        the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, <v n="16"/>and would not allow
        anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. <v n="17"/>And as he taught them, he
        said, "Is it not written: "'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But
        you have made it 'a den of robbers.'" <v n="18"/>The chief priests and the teachers of the
        law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the
        whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. <v n="19"/>When evening came, they went out of the
        city. <v n="20"/>In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the
        roots. <v n="21"/>Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed
        has withered!" <v n="22"/>"Have faith in God," Jesus answered. <v n="23"/>"I tell you the
        truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not
        doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. <v
            n="24"/>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have
        received it, and it will be yours. <v n="25"/>And when you stand praying, if you hold
        anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your
        sins." <v n="26"/>See Footnote <v n="27"/>They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus
        was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders
        came to him. <v n="28"/>"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who
        gave you authority to do this?" <v n="29"/>Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question.
        Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. <v n="30"/>John's
        baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!" <v n="31"/>They discussed it among
        themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe
        him?' <v n="32"/>But if we say, 'From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held
        that John really was a prophet.) <v n="33"/>So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus
        said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things." <c n="12"/>
        <v n="1"/>He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a
        wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the
        vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. <v n="2"/>At harvest time he sent a
        servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. <v n="3"/>But
        they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. <v n="4"/>Then he sent another
        servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. <v n="5"/>He
        sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat,
        others they killed. <v n="6"/>"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him
        last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.' <v n="7"/>"But the tenants said to one
        another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' <v
            n="8"/>So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. <v n="9"
        />"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give
        the vineyard to others. <v n="10"/>Haven't you read this scripture: "'The stone the builders
        rejected has become the capstone; <v n="11"/>the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in
        our eyes'?" <v n="12"/>Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had
        spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and
        went away. <v n="13"/>Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch
        him in his words. <v n="14"/>They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of
        integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you
        teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or
        not? <v n="15"/>Should we pay or shouldn't we?" <v n="16"/>But Jesus knew their hypocrisy.
        "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it." They
        brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose
        inscription?Caesar's," they replied. <v n="17"/>Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar
        what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him. <v n="18"/>Then the
        Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. <v n="19"
        />"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife
        but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. <v n="20"
        />Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any
        children. <v n="21"/>The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child.
        It was the same with the third. <v n="22"/>In fact, none of the seven left any children.
        Last of all, the woman died too. <v n="23"/>At the resurrection whose wife will she be,
        since the seven were married to her?" <v n="24"/>Jesus replied, "Are you not in error
        because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? <v n="25"/>When the dead rise,
        they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. <v
            n="26"/>Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the
        account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
        the God of Jacob'? <v n="27"/>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are
        badly mistaken!" <v n="28"/>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating.
        Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments,
        which is the most important?" <v n="29"/>"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this:
        'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <v n="30"/>Love the Lord your God with
        all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <v
            n="31"/>The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment
        greater than these." <v n="32"/>"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in
        saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <v n="33"/>To love him with all your
        heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as
        yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices." <v n="34"/>When Jesus
        saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."
        And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <v n="35"/>While Jesus was
        teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that
        the Christ is the son of David? <v n="36"/>David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit,
        declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under
        your feet."' <v n="37"/>David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The
        large crowd listened to him with delight. <v n="38"/>As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out
        for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the
        marketplaces, <v n="39"/>and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places
        of honor at banquets. <v n="40"/>They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy
        prayers. Such men will be punished most severely." <v n="41"/>Jesus sat down opposite the
        place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple
        treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. <v n="42"/>But a poor widow came and put
        in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. <v n="43"/>Calling his
        disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the
        treasury than all the others. <v n="44"/>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of
        her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on." <c n="13"/>
        <v n="1"/>As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher!
        What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!" <v n="2"/>"Do you see all these great
        buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be
        thrown down." <v n="3"/>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,
        Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, <v n="4"/>"Tell us, when will these
        things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?" <v n="5"
        />Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you. <v n="6"/>Many will come in my
        xml:id, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many. <v n="7"/>When you hear of wars and
        rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. <v
            n="8"/>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
        earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. <v n="9"
        />"You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in
        the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to
        them. <v n="10"/>And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. <v n="11"/>Whenever
        you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say
        whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. <v
            n="12"/>"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will
        rebel against their parents and have them put to death. <v n="13"/>All men will hate you
        because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. <v n="14"/>"When you see
        'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader
        understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <v n="15"/>Let no one on
        the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out. <v n="16"/>Let no one
        in the field go back to get his cloak. <v n="17"/>How dreadful it will be in those days for
        pregnant women and nursing mothers! <v n="18"/>Pray that this will not take place in winter,
            <v n="19"/>because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God
        created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again. <v n="20"/>If the Lord had not
        cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has
        chosen, he has shortened them. <v n="21"/>At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is
        the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. <v n="22"/>For false Christs and
        false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were
        possible. <v n="23"/>So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. <v
            n="24"/>"But in those days, following that distress, "'the sun will be darkened, and the
        moon will not give its light; <v n="25"/>the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly
        bodies will be shaken.' <v n="26"/>"At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in
        clouds with great power and glory. <v n="27"/>And he will send his angels and gather his
        elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens. <v n="28"
        />"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves
        come out, you know that summer is near. <v n="29"/>Even so, when you see these things
        happening, you know that it is near, right at the door. <v n="30"/>I tell you the truth,
        this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <v n="31"
        />Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <v n="32"/>"No one
        knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
        Father. <v n="33"/>Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come. <v
            n="34"/>It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge,
        each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. <v n="35"
        />"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come
        back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. <v
            n="36"/>If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. <v n="37"/>What I say to
        you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'" <c n="14"/>
        <v n="1"/>Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and
        the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus
        and kill him. <v n="2"/>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot." <v
            n="3"/>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as
        Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure
        nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <v n="4"/>Some of those present
        were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume? <v n="5"/>It could have
        been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked
        her harshly. <v n="6"/>"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has
        done a beautiful thing to me. <v n="7"/>The poor you will always have with you, and you can
        help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. <v n="8"/>She did what she
        could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <v n="9"/>I tell
        you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will
        also be told, in memory of her." <v n="10"/>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to
        the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <v n="11"/>They were delighted to hear this and
        promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <v n="12"/>On
        the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the
        Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations
        for you to eat the Passover?" <v n="13"/>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go
        into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <v n="14"/>Say
        to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may
        eat the Passover with my disciples?' <v n="15"/>He will show you a large upper room,
        furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there." <v n="16"/>The disciples left, went
        into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
            <v n="17"/>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <v n="18"/>While they were
        reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray
        me--one who is eating with me." <v n="19"/>They were saddened, and one by one they said to
        him, "Surely not I?" <v n="20"/>"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread
        into the bowl with me. <v n="21"/>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him.
        But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not
        been born." <v n="22"/>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it,
        and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body." <v n="23"/>Then he took
        the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <v n="24"/>"This is
        my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them. <v n="25"/>"I tell
        you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink
        it anew in the kingdom of God." <v n="26"/>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the
        Mount of Olives. <v n="27"/>"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written:
        "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <v n="28"/>But after I have
        risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." <v n="29"/>Peter declared, "Even if all fall
        away, I will not." <v n="30"/>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes,
        tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times." <v n="31"
        />But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown
        you." And all the others said the same. <v n="32"/>They went to a place called Gethsemane,
        and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray." <v n="33"/>He took Peter, James
        and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <v n="34"/>"My
        soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep
        watch." <v n="35"/>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible
        the hour might pass from him. <v n="36"/>"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible
        for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will." <v n="37"/>Then he
        returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you
        asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <v n="38"/>Watch and pray so that you will
        not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak." <v n="39"/>Once more
        he went away and prayed the same thing. <v n="40"/>When he came back, he again found them
        sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <v n="41"
        />Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough!
        The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <v n="42"
        />Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!" <v n="43"/>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one
        of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the
        chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <v n="44"/>Now the betrayer had
        arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under
        guard." <v n="45"/>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him. <v n="46"
        />The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <v n="47"/>Then one of those standing near drew his
        sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <v n="48"/>"Am I
        leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture
        me? <v n="49"/>Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not
        arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled." <v n="50"/>Then everyone deserted him and
        fled. <v n="51"/>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When
        they seized him, <v n="52"/>he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <v n="53"/>They took
        Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came
        together. <v n="54"/>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high
        priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <v n="55"/>The chief
        priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could
        put him to death, but they did not find any. <v n="56"/>Many testified falsely against him,
        but their statements did not agree. <v n="57"/>Then some stood up and gave this false
        testimony against him: <v n="58"/>"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple
        and in three days will build another, not made by man.'" <v n="59"/>Yet even then their
        testimony did not agree. <v n="60"/>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked
        Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing
        against you?" <v n="61"/>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest
        asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?" <v n="62"/>"I am," said Jesus.
        "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on
        the clouds of heaven." <v n="63"/>The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more
        witnesses?" he asked. <v n="64"/>"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" <v
            n="65"/>They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they
        blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him
        and beat him. <v n="66"/>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of
        the high priest came by. <v n="67"/>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely
        at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said. <v n="68"/>But he denied it. "I
        don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the
        entryway. <v n="69"/>When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing
        around, "This fellow is one of them." <v n="70"/>Again he denied it. After a little while,
        those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean." <v
            n="71"/>He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know
        this man you're talking about." <v n="72"/>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.
        Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you
        will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept. <c n="15"/>
        <v n="1"/>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the
        law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed
        him over to Pilate. <v n="2"/>"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as
        you say," Jesus replied. <v n="3"/>The chief priests accused him of many things. <v n="4"
        />So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are
        accusing you of." <v n="5"/>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. <v n="6"
        />Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <v
            n="7"/>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed
        murder in the uprising. <v n="8"/>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he
        usually did. <v n="9"/>"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked
        Pilate, <v n="10"/>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over
        to him. <v n="11"/>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release
        Barabbas instead. <v n="12"/>"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the
        Jews?" Pilate asked them. <v n="13"/>"Crucify him!" they shouted. <v n="14"/>"Why? What
        crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!" <v
            n="15"/>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus
        flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <v n="16"/>The soldiers led Jesus away into
        the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <v
            n="17"/>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set
        it on him. <v n="18"/>And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" <v n="19"
        />Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their
        knees, they paid homage to him. <v n="20"/>And when they had mocked him, they took off the
        purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. <v n="21"
        />A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his
        way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <v n="22"/>They brought
        Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <v n="23"/>Then
        they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <v n="24"/>And they
        crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. <v n="25"
        />It was the third hour when they crucified him. <v n="26"/>The written notice of the charge
        against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <v n="27"/>They crucified two robbers with him, one
        on his right and one on his left. <v n="28"/>See Footnote <v n="29"/>Those who passed by
        hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the
        temple and build it in three days, <v n="30"/>come down from the cross and save yourself!"
            <v n="31"/>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him
        among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! <v n="32"/>Let
        this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and
        believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <v n="33"/>At the sixth hour
        darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <v n="34"/>And at the ninth hour
        Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my
        God, why have you forsaken me?" <v n="35"/>When some of those standing near heard this, they
        said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah." <v n="36"/>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine
        vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's
        see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said. <v n="37"/>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed
        his last. <v n="38"/>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <v n="39"
        />And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he
        died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!" <v n="40"/>Some women were watching
        from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of
        Joses, and Salome. <v n="41"/>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his
        needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. <v n="42"/>It
        was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, <v
            n="43"/>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting
        for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. <v n="44"/>Pilate
        was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if
        Jesus had already died. <v n="45"/>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he
        gave the body to Joseph. <v n="46"/>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body,
        wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone
        against the entrance of the tomb. <v n="47"/>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw
        where he was laid. <c n="16"/>
        <v n="1"/>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome
        bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body. <v n="2"/>Very early on the first
        day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb <v n="3"/>and they
        asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" <v n="4"
        />But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled
        away. <v n="5"/>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe
        sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. <v n="6"/>"Don't be alarmed," he said.
        "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here.
        See the place where they laid him. <v n="7"/>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is
        going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'" <v n="8"
        />Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to
        anyone, because they were afraid. <v n="9"/>When Jesus rose early on the first day of the
        week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. <v n="10"
        />She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping. <v n="11"
        />When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
            <v n="12"/>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were
        walking in the country. <v n="13"/>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did
        not believe them either. <v n="14"/>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating;
        he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had
        seen him after he had risen. <v n="15"/>He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach
        the good news to all creation. <v n="16"/>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved,
        but whoever does not believe will be condemned. <v n="17"/>And these signs will accompany
        those who believe: In my xml:id they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
            <v n="18"/>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison,
        it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get
        well." <v n="19"/>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and
        he sat at the right hand of God. <v n="20"/>Then the disciples went out and preached
        everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that
        accompanied it. </body>
