       <div class="info"> <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p><img src="fp.jpg" alt="A female United Methodist pastor." id="left"/>In the area of gender, the contrast between the UMC and SBC is sharp, and the
            words on their websites can be easily predicted from the explanations in their
            commentaries. For all of the passages in the epistles providing instructions for the way
            women ought to behave both in church and at home, the UMC commentary explains the
            cultural context in which such instructions made sense while the SBC commentary defends
            them as being compatible with contemporary western culture. For example, 1 Timothy
            1:11-12 forbids women from teaching and commands them to remain silent in church. From
            the UMC commentary a reader gathers that the churches Paul was writing to met in houses
            so ordinary household order in which men had the authority had to maintained within the
            church; furthermore, the early church had to be supportive of the ordinary household
            order because to do otherwise was to discourage converts and to draw persecution from
            both Roman and Jewish authorities (Dunn 800-802). The SBS commentary does not refute any
            part of it, but it adds that even today, if women had authority positions in the church,
            they would be too busy to devote sufficient energy to raising their children (Lea
            94-105). </p>
        <p> Extrapolating these sorts of interpretations into viewpoints, it would be reasonable to
            posit that the UMC website would regard gender in a way that makes the church palatable
            to modern western culture in a similar way that Paul did to his culture, and that the
            SBC would ask modern church members to follow the rules found in such passages. Indeed,
            this is what one finds. From the UMC website: “We therefore urge that every effort be
            made to eliminate sex-role stereotypes in activity and portrayal of family life and in
            all aspects of voluntary and compensatory participation in the Church and society.” From
            the SBC website: “While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the
            office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.” </p></div>
