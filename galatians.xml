            by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- <v n="7"/>which is really
            no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying

            <v n="1"/>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus
            Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <v n="2"/>I would like to learn just one
            thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what
            you heard? <v n="3"/>Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now
            trying to attain your goal by human effort? <v n="4"/>Have you suffered so much for
            nothing--if it really was for nothing? <v n="5"/>Does God give you his Spirit and work
            miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you heard?
                <v n="6"/>Consider <name ref="Abraham">Abraham</name>: <description ref="Abraham"
                type="good">"He believed God, and it was credited to him as
                righteousness."</description>
            <esi tone="instructive" ethnicity="gentile"><v n="7"/>Understand, then, that those who

            <esi ethnicity="jew" tone="condemning"><v n="10"/>All who rely on observing the law are
                under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do
                everything written in the Book of the Law." <v n="11"/>Clearly no one is justified
                before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith." <v n="12"/>The
                law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live
                by them." <v n="13"/>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a

            <esi tone="praise" ethnicity="gentile"><v n="14"/>He redeemed us in order that the

        </section>
        <section><v n="15"/>Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can
            set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this
            case. <v n="16"/>The promises were spoken to <name ref="Abraham">Abraham</name> and to
            his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to
            your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ. <v n="17"/>What I mean is this: The law,
            introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by
            God and thus do away with the promise. <v n="18"/>For if the inheritance depends on the
            law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to <name
                ref="Abraham">Abraham</name> through a promise. <v n="19"/>What, then, was the
            purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the
            promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. <v
                n="20"/>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one. <v
                n="21"/>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For
            if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have
            come by the law. <v n="22"/>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a
            prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ,
            might be given to those who believe. </section>
        <section><v n="23"/>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up
            until faith should be revealed. <v n="24"/>So the law was put in charge to lead us to
            Christ that we might be justified by faith. <v n="25"/>Now that faith has come, we are
            no longer under the supervision of the law. <v n="26"/>You are all sons of God through
            faith in Christ Jesus, <v n="27"/>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have
            clothed yourselves with Christ. <v n="28"/>There is <esi ethnicity="all" tone="praise"
                >neither Jew nor Greek</esi>, <csi tone="praise" class="all">slave nor free</csi>,
                <gsi tone="praise" gender="both">male nor female</gsi>, for you are all one in
            Christ Jesus. <v n="29"/>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs
            according to the promise. <c n="4"/>
            <v n="1"/>What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different
            from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. <v n="2"/>He is subject to guardians
            and trustees until the time set by his father. <v n="3"/>So also, when we were children,
            we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world. <v n="4"/>But when the time
            had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, <v n="5"/>to redeem
            those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. <v n="6"/>Because you
            are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out,
            "Abba, Father." <v n="7"/>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a
            son, God has made you also an heir. </section>
        <section><v n="8"/>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by
            nature are not gods. <v n="9"/>But now that you know God--or rather are known by
            God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you
            wish to be enslaved by them all over again? <v n="10"/>You are observing special days
            and months and seasons and years! <v n="11"/>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted
            my efforts on you. <v n="12"/>I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became
            like you. You have done me no wrong. <v n="13"/>As you know, it was because of an
            illness that I first preached the gospel to you. <v n="14"/>Even though my illness was a
            trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as
            if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. <v n="15"/>What has
            happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have
            torn out your eyes and given them to me. <v n="16"/>Have I now become your enemy by
            telling you the truth? <v n="17"/>Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no
            good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them. <v
                n="18"/>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always
            and not just when I am with you. <v n="19"/>My dear children, for whom I am again in the
            pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, <v n="20"/>how I wish I could be with
            you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! </section>
        <section><v n="21"/>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the
            law says? <v n="22"/>For it is written that<name ref="Abraham"> Abraham</name> had

                <description ref="Ishmael" type="bad">the slave woman's son will never share in the
                inheritance with the free woman's son</description>." <v n="31"/>Therefore,
            brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. </section>
        <section>
            <c n="5"/>
            <v n="1"/>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not
            let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. <v n="2"/>Mark my words! I, Paul,
            tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at
            all. <v n="3"/>Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is
            obligated to obey the whole law. <v n="4"/>You who are trying to be justified by law
            have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. <v n="5"/>But by faith
            we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. <v n="6"/>For
            in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing
            that counts is faith expressing itself through love. <v n="7"/>You were running a good
            race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? <v n="8"/>That kind of
            persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. <v n="9"/>"A little yeast works
            through the whole batch of dough." <v n="10"/>I am confident in the Lord that you will
            take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty,
            whoever he may be. <v n="11"/>Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I
            still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. <v
                n="12"/>As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate
            themselves! </section>
        <section><v n="13"/>You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to
            indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. <v n="14"/>The entire law
            is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." <v n="15"/>If you
            keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each
            other. <v n="16"/>So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of
            the sinful nature. <v n="17"/>For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the
            Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with
            each other, so that you do not do what you want. <v n="18"/>But if you are led by the
            Spirit, you are not under law. <v n="19"/>The acts of the sinful nature are obvious:
            sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <v n="20"/>idolatry and witchcraft; hatred,
            discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <v n="21"/>and
            envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who
            live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. <v n="22"/>But the fruit of the
            Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <v n="23"
            />gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <v n="24"/>Those who
            belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.
                <v n="25"/>Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <v
                n="26"/>Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. </section>
        <section>
            <c n="6"/>
            <v n="1"/>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore
            him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. <v n="2"/>Carry each other's
            burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. <v n="3"/>If anyone thinks
            he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <v n="4"/>Each one should test
            his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to
            somebody else, <v n="5"/>for each one should carry his own load. <v n="6"/>Anyone who
            receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor. <v
                n="7"/>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. <v n="8"
            />The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction;
            the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. <v n="9"
            />Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest
            if we do not give up. <v n="10"/>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to
            all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. </section>

    <conclusion><v n="11"/>See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! <v
            n="12"/>Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to
        be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of
        Christ. <v n="13"/>Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be
        circumcised that they may boast about your flesh. <v n="14"/>May I never boast except in the
        cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to
        the world. <v n="15"/>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is
        a new creation. <esi tone="praise" ethnicity="jew"><v n="16"/>Peace and mercy to all who
            follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</esi>
        <v n="17"/>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
            <v n="18"/>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
        Amen.</conclusion>
