            <p>The New Testament of the Christian Bible has been shaping American culture since the
                Puritans first settled this continent because their interpretation of it did not
                mesh with the Anglican church’s. American culture has diversified quite a bit since
                that first colony on Plymouth Rock, but one thing that hasn’t changed is the fact
                that people who call themselves Christians interpret the New Testament in
                drastically different ways, and that these different interpretations have
                far-reaching ramifications regarding how they live their lives, how they think other
                people ought to live their lives, and how they relate to the government. </p><p>In
                my research, I was particularly interested in the way parts of the New Testament are
                used as a weapon by Christians on both sides of the American political spectrum, to
                the extent that they tend to label those with opposite opinions as not actually
                being Christians. By using digital humanities technologies to gather data on the
                demographics of the characters in the gospels and the book of Acts as well as the
                people addresses by Paul in his epistles and comparing that to the interpretations
                offered by the largest mainline denomination in the US (the United Methodist Church)
                and largest evangelical denomination (the Southern Baptist Convention), I have
                attempted to answer questions like: </p><img id="right" alt="Jesus meme"
                src="right.jpg" width="300" height="276.75" /><p class="q">Who gets Jesus? </p><p
                class="q">Who gets Paul? </p><p class="q"> Do Jesus and Paul even preach the same
                gospel? </p><p class="q"> What would Jesus do in an election year? </p><p>Click
                around to see what I discovered, and to get background information on the differences between the world in
                which the New Testament was written and the world to which we are applying it
                today.</p>
