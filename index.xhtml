            <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
            <p><img id="left" alt="Jesus meme" src="left.jpg" width="300" height="376.5" />In various research projects I have undertaken, I have often noticed a distinct lack
                of statistics regarding the demographic data of the characters in the new testament.
                For example, if I am going to make a statement like "Relative to the culture in
                which it was written, the Bible has a lot of female characters", I would like to be
                able to back that up by providing the percentage of characters who are female, but I
                was unsuccessful in finding that percentage. Thus, the primary purpose of this site
                is to give you the statistics I have managed to produce: things like the percentage
                of characters who are woman and who are Jewish and who are poor, and the percentage
                of the speaking that is done by men verses women. For more on that, see the
                conclusions page.</p>
            <p>The other half of this puzzle for me was the way that objectively, there are numbers
                that can be found, and I found them, but that doesn't change the fact that
                Christians always have and probably always will disagree wildly on issues related to
                demographics, such as the role of women in the church. Thus I decided to look at the
                interpretations done by the two largest denominations in the United States on all of
                the passages in the New Testament in which instruction are given for a specific
                group. A summary of thoe findings are on this site as well.</p>
