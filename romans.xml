    <body>
        <section><v n="8"/>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your
            faith is being reported all over the world. <v n="9"/>God, whom I serve with my whole
            heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you <v
                n="10"/>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the
            way may be opened for me to come to you. <v n="11"/>I long to see you so that I may
            impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong-- <v n="12"/>that is, that you and
            I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. <v n="13"/>I do not want you to be
            unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented
            from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have
            had among the other Gentiles. <v n="14"/>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks,
            both to the wise and the foolish. <v n="15"/>That is why I am so eager to preach the
            gospel also to you who are at Rome. <v n="16"/>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because
            it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: <esi ethnicity="jew"
                tone="unspecified">first for the Jew</esi>, <esi tone="unspecified"
                ethnicity="gentile">then for the Gentile</esi>. <v n="17"/>For in the gospel a
            righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,
            just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." </section>
        <section><v n="18"/>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the
            godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <v n="19"
            />since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to
            them. <v n="20"/>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his
            eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has
            been made, so that men are without excuse. <v n="21"/>For although they knew God, they
            neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile
            and their foolish hearts were darkened. <v n="22"/>Although they claimed to be wise,
            they became fools <v n="23"/>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made
            to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <v n="24"/>Therefore God
            gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the
            degrading of their bodies with one another. <v n="25"/>They exchanged the truth of God
            for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is
            forever praised. Amen. <v n="26"/>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.
                <gsi tone="condemning" gender="female">Even their women exchanged natural relations
                for unnatural ones</gsi>. <v n="27"/><gsi gender="male" tone="condemning">In the
                same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
                lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
                themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</gsi>
            <v n="28"/>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge
            of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <v n="29"
            />They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They
            are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <v n="30"
            />slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing
            evil; they disobey their parents; <v n="31"/>they are senseless, faithless, heartless,
            ruthless. <v n="32"/>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such
            things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of
            those who practice them.</section>
        <section><c n="2"/>
            <v n="1"/>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at
            whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass
            judgment do the same things. <v n="2"/>Now we know that God's judgment against those who
            do such things is based on truth. <v n="3"/>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on
            them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? <v n="4"
            />Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not
            realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance? <v n="5"/>But because of your
            stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for
            the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. <v n="6"/>God
            "will give to each person according to what he has done." <v n="7"/>To those who by
            persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
                <v n="8"/>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow
            evil, there will be wrath and anger. <v n="9"/><esi tone="condemning" ethnicity="all"
                >There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for
                the Jew, then for the Gentile</esi>; <v n="10"/><esi ethnicity="all" tone="praise"
                >but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for
                the Gentile.</esi>
            <v n="11"/>For God does not show favoritism. <v n="12"/>All who sin apart from the law
            will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the
            law. <v n="13"/>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight,
            but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. <v n="14"/>(Indeed,
                <esi tone="unspecified" ethnicity="gentile">when Gentiles, who do not have the law,
                do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though
                they do not have the law, <v n="15"/>since they show that the requirements of the
                law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their
                thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.</esi>) <v n="16"/>This will take
            place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel
            declares. </section>
        <section><v n="17"/>Now you, <esi ethnicity="jew" tone="condemning">if you call yourself a
                Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God; <v n="18"/>if
                you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the
                law; <v n="19"/>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for
                those who are in the dark, <v n="20"/>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
                infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth-- <v

                it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." <v
                    n="25"/>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law,
                you have become as though you had not been circumcised. </esi>
            <esi tone="praise" ethnicity="gentile"><v n="26"/>If those who are not circumcised keep
                the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?

                    n="29"/>No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is
                circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's
                praise is not from men, but from God.</esi>

        <section><c n="3"/>
            <esi tone="instructive" ethnicity="jew"><v n="1"/>What advantage, then, is there in
                being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? <v n="2"/>Much in every way!
                First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God. <v n="3"/>What if
                some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness? <v
                    n="4"/>Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: "So
                that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge." <v n="5"
                />But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall
                we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human
                argument.) <v n="6"/>Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
                    <v n="7"/>Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and
                so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?" <v n="8"/>Why not
                say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we
                say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.</esi>
        </section>
        <section><esi ethnicity="jew" tone="instructive"><v n="9"/>What shall we conclude then? Are
                we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles
                alike are all under sin. <v n="10"/>As it is written: "There is no one righteous,
                not even one; <v n="11"/>there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. <v
                    n="12"/>All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no
                one who does good, not even one." <v n="13"/>"Their throats are open graves; their
                tongues practice deceit.The poison of vipers is on their lips." <v n="14"/>"Their
                mouths are full of cursing and bitterness." <v n="15"/>"Their feet are swift to shed
                blood; <v n="16"/>ruin and misery mark their ways, <v n="17"/>and the way of peace
                they do not know." <v n="18"/>"There is no fear of God before their eyes." <v n="19"
                />Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so
                that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. <v
                    n="20"/>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing
                the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.</esi>
        </section>
        <section><esi tone="instructive" ethnicity="all"><v n="21"/>But now a righteousness from
                God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
                    <v n="22"/>This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to
                all who believe. There is no difference, <v n="23"/>for all have sinned and fall
                short of the glory of God, <v n="24"/>and are justified freely by his grace through
                the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. <v n="25"/>God presented him as a
                sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his
                justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand
                unpunished-- <v n="26"/>he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so
                as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. <v n="27"
                />Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing
                the law? No, but on that of faith. <v n="28"/>For we maintain that a man is
                justified by faith apart from observing the law. <v n="29"/>Is God the God of Jews

        <section><c n="5"/>
            <v n="1"/>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God
            through our Lord Jesus Christ, <v n="2"/>through whom we have gained access by faith
            into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
                <v n="3"/>Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that
            suffering produces perseverance; <v n="4"/>perseverance, character; and character, hope.
                <v n="5"/>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into
            our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us. <v n="6"/>You see, at just the
            right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. <v n="7"/>Very
            rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly
            dare to die. <v n="8"/>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were
            still sinners, Christ died for us. <v n="9"/>Since we have now been justified by his
            blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! <v n="10"/>For if,
            when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how
            much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! <v n="11"/>Not
            only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
            we have now received reconciliation.</section>
        <section><v n="12"/>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death
            through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- <v n="13"/>for
            before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when
            there is no law. <v n="14"/>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of <name
                ref="Adam">Adam</name> to the time of <name ref="Moses">Moses</name>, even over
            those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did <name ref="Adam">Adam</name>, who
            was a pattern of the one to come. <v n="15"/>But the gift is not like the trespass. For
            if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the
            gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <v
                n="16"/>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The
            judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many
            trespasses and brought justification. <v n="17"/>For if, by the trespass of the one man,
            death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant
            provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man,
            Jesus Christ. <v n="18"/>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was
            condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was
            justification that brings life for all men. <v n="19"/>For just as through the
            disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of
            the one man the many will be made righteous. <v n="20"/>The law was added so that the
            trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, <v
                n="21"/>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through
            righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</section>
        <section>
            <c n="6"/>
            <v n="1"/>What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? <v
                n="2"/>By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? <v n="3"/>Or
            don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
            death? <v n="4"/>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order
            that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too
            may live a new life. <v n="5"/>If we have been united with him like this in his death,
            we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. <v n="6"/>For we know
            that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away
            with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin-- <v n="7"/>because anyone who has died
            has been freed from sin. <v n="8"/>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will
            also live with him. <v n="9"/>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he
            cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. <v n="10"/>The death he died, he
            died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. <v n="11"/>In the same
            way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. <v n="12"/>Therefore
            do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. <v n="13"
            />Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather
            offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer
            the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. <v n="14"/>For sin shall
            not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace. </section>
        <section><v n="15"/>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By
            no means! <v n="16"/>Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey
            him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin,
            which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? <v n="17"/>But
            thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed
            the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. <v n="18"/>You have been set free from
            sin and have become slaves to righteousness. <v n="19"/>I put this in human terms
            because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your
            body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in
            slavery to righteousness leading to holiness. <v n="20"/>When you were slaves to sin,
            you were free from the control of righteousness. <v n="21"/>What benefit did you reap at
            that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! <v
                n="22"/>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God,
            the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. <v n="23"/>For
            the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. </section>
        <section><c n="7"/>
            <v n="1"/>Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the
            law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? <v n="2"/>For example, <gsi
                gender="female" tone="unspecified">by law a married woman is bound to her husband as
                long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
                marriage. <v n="3"/>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
                alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
                that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man</gsi>. <v
                n="4"/>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that
            you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might
            bear fruit to God. <v n="5"/>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the
            sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for
            death. <v n="6"/>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the
            law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written
            code.</section>
        <section><v n="7"/>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would
            not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what
            coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." <v n="8"/>But sin, seizing
            the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous
            desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. <v n="9"/>Once I was alive apart from law; but
            when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. <v n="10"/>I found that the
            very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. <v n="11"/>For
            sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the
            commandment put me to death. <v n="12"/>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is
            holy, righteous and good. <v n="13"/>Did that which is good, then, become death to me?
            By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me
            through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
                <v n="14"/>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave
            to sin. <v n="15"/>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but
            what I hate I do. <v n="16"/>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law
            is good. <v n="17"/>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living
            in me. <v n="18"/>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
            For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. <v n="19"/>For what
            I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on
            doing. <v n="20"/>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but
            it is sin living in me that does it. <v n="21"/>So I find this law at work: When I want
            to do good, evil is right there with me. <v n="22"/>For in my inner being I delight in
            God's law; <v n="23"/>but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging
            war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within
            my members. <v n="24"/>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of
            death? <v n="25"/>Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in
            my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of
            sin.</section>
        <section>
            <c n="8"/>
            <v n="1"/>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <v
                n="2"/>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from
            the law of sin and death. <v n="3"/>For what the law was powerless to do in that it was
            weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
            man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <v n="4"/>in order that
            the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live
            according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <v n="5"/>Those who live
            according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but
            those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit
            desires. <v n="6"/>The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the
            Spirit is life and peace; <v n="7"/>the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not
            submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <v n="8"/>Those controlled by the sinful nature
            cannot please God. <v n="9"/>You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but
            by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit
            of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <v n="10"/>But if Christ is in you, your body
            is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <v n="11"
            />And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who
            raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his
            Spirit, who lives in you. <v n="12"/>Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it
            is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <v n="13"/>For if you live
            according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the
            misdeeds of the body, you will live, <v n="14"/>because those who are led by the Spirit
            of God are sons of God. <v n="15"/>For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a
            slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba,
            Father." <v n="16"/>The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's
            children. <v n="17"/>Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and
            co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also
            share in his glory.</section>
        <section><v n="18"/>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the
            glory that will be revealed in us. <v n="19"/>The creation waits in eager expectation
            for the sons of God to be revealed. <v n="20"/>For the creation was subjected to
            frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
                <v n="21"/>that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and
            brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <v n="22"/>We know that the
            whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present
            time. <v n="23"/>Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
            groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our
            bodies. <v n="24"/>For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at
            all. Who hopes for what he already has? <v n="25"/>But if we hope for what we do not yet
            have, we wait for it patiently. <v n="26"/>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our
            weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes
            for us with groans that words cannot express. <v n="27"/>And he who searches our hearts
            knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance
            with God's will. <v n="28"/>And we know that in all things God works for the good of
            those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <v n="29"/>For those
            God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he
            might be the firstborn among many brothers. <v n="30"/>And those he predestined, he also
            called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. </section>
        <section><v n="31"/>What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can
            be against us? <v n="32"/>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us

                    <v n="3"/>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and
                sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</esi>
            <v n="4"/>Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone

            descend into the deep?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <v n="8"/>But what
            does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the

            another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. <v n="9"/>The
            commandments, "Do not commit adultery,Do not murder,Do not steal,Do not covet," and
            whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: "Love your
            neighbor as yourself." <v n="10"/>Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is
            the fulfillment of the law. </section>
        <section><v n="11"/>And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you
            to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first
            believed. <v n="12"/>The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put
            aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. <v n="13"/>Let us behave
            decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and
            debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. <v n="14"/>Rather, clothe yourselves with
            the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful
            nature.</section>

            <v n="1"/>Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable
            matters. <v n="2"/>One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose
            faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <v n="3"/>The man who eats everything must not look
            down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the
            man who does, for God has accepted him. <v n="4"/>Who are you to judge someone else's
            servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able
            to make him stand. <v n="5"/>One man considers one day more sacred than another; another
            man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <v
                n="6"/>He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat,
            eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord
            and gives thanks to God. <v n="7"/>For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us
            dies to himself alone. <v n="8"/>If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die
            to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. <v n="9"/>For this very
            reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead
            and the living. <v n="10"/>You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look
            down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. <v n="11"/>It is
            written: "'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every
            tongue will confess to God.'" <v n="12"/>So then, each of us will give an account of
            himself to God. <v n="13"/>Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another.
            Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's
            way. <v n="14"/>As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is
            unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is
            unclean. <v n="15"/>If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no
            longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.
                <v n="16"/>Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <v n="17"
            />For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness,
            peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <v n="18"/>because anyone who serves Christ in this
            way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <v n="19"/>Let us therefore make every
            effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <v n="20"/>Do not destroy
            the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to
            eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <v n="21"/>It is better not to eat
            meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <v
                n="22"/>So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God.
            Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <v n="23"/>But the
            man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and
            everything that does not come from faith is sin. <c n="15"/>
            <v n="1"/>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to
            please ourselves. <v n="2"/>Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build
            him up. <v n="3"/>For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: "The
            insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." <v n="4"/>For everything that was
            written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the
            encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. <v n="5"/>May the God who gives
            endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow
            Christ Jesus, <v n="6"/>so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and
            Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <v n="7"/>Accept one another, then, just as Christ
            accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.<esi tone="instructive" ethnicity="jew">
                <v n="8"/>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of
                God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs</esi>
            <esi ethnicity="gentile" tone="instructive"><v n="9"/>so that the Gentiles may glorify

                says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the
                nations; the Gentiles will hope in him." <v n="13"/>May the God of hope fill you
                with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by
                the power of the Holy Spirit.</esi></section>
        <section>
            <v n="14"/>I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness,
            complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another. <esi tone="instructive"
                ethnicity="gentile"><v n="15"/>I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if
                to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me <v n="16"/>to be a
                minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the
                gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God,
                sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </esi><v n="17"/>Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in
            my service to God. <esi ethnicity="gentile" tone="instructive"><v n="18"/>I will not
                venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in
                leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done-- <v n="19"/>by the
                power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all
                the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. <v n="20"
                />It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so
                that I would not be building on someone else's foundation. <v n="21"/>Rather, as it
                is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not
                heard will understand."</esi>
            <v n="22"/>This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. </section>
        <section><v n="23"/>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and
            since I have been longing for many years to see you, <v n="24"/>I plan to do so when I
            go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my
            journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. <v n="25"/>Now, however, I
            am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there. <v n="26"/>For Macedonia
            and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in
            Jerusalem. <v n="27"/>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. <esi
                tone="instructive" ethnicity="gentile">For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews'
                spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material
                blessings. </esi><v n="28"/>So after I have completed this task and have made sure
            that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. <v
                n="29"/>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the
            blessing of Christ. <v n="30"/>I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the
            love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. <v n="31"/>Pray
            that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may
            be acceptable to the saints there, <v n="32"/>so that by God's will I may come to you
            with joy and together with you be refreshed. <v n="33"/>The God of peace be with you
