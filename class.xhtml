        <p><img src="poor.jpg" alt="Poor children" id="left"/>There is very little difference in the way that the UMC and the SBC view class, but they
            approach the issue from two very different frameworks. Both the UMC and the SBC believe
            that helping those less fortunate is the duty of Christians, as per Jesusâ€™ example.
            Nonetheless, as per the attitudes of brevity verses comprehensiveness seen earlier, the
            SBC simply states once that helping the needy is a thing which should be done, whereas
            one of the primary goals that pervades the UMC website is helping the impoverished and
            underprivileged worldwide, both on an immediate food and shelter basis and on a lasting
            systematic overhaul of the societies that allow poverty to thrive. When it comes to the
            viewpoints expressed in the printed commentaries on the passages relevant to a
            discussion of social class, it is difficult to make any kind of comprehensive statement
            of similarity and difference because the focus varied widely based upon the specific
            passages. One thing that is evident a more application-focused approached in the SBC
            commentary and a more context-based approach in the UMC commentary. For example, 2
            Corinthians 8:1-15 describes the early church living in community with shared material
            resources. The UMC describes this passes as being an example of the way spiritual and
            material blessing were equated in the early church such that repaying a spiritual gift
            with a monetary one was common practice (Sampley 121-124) while the SBC makes sure
            readers know that this passage cannot be used in a modern context to condone socialism
            (Garland 365-380). In passages regarding slavery such as Titus 2:9-10, the UMC does not
            mince words and just lays out the fact that Paul was writing a household code in the way
            household codes were written, addressing slaves last (Dunn 870). Conversely, the SBC
            attempts to utilize this passage as an example of the early church being inclusive of
            oppressed groups due to the fact that the slaves are considered worthy of instruction at
            al (Lea 305-309). In a general sense, however, both the SBC and the UMC would agree that
            the church should pay attention to and attempt to improve the lot of humans who belong
            to oft-neglected social classes. </p></div>
