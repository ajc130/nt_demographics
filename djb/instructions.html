         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is

            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone

            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word

            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both

            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in

            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by

            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she

            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.

            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,

            women exchanged natural relations

            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word

            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter

            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere

            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do

            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of

            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love

            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right

            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,

            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do

            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of

            to

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no

            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband

            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to

            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and

            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as

            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then

         <li>male prostitutes Do you not know that he who unites
            himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will
            become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with
            him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits
            are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. It is good
            for a man not to marry. each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband
            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must

            The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife likewise the wife to her husband
            The wife's body does not belong to
            her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not
            belong to him alone but also to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband.
            But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her
            husband. a husband must not divorce
            his wife. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to
            live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is
            not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the
            unbelieving husband has been
            sanctified through his wife the
            unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband How do you know,
            wife, whether you will save your husband? how do you know, husband, whether you will
            save your wife? Are you unmarried?
            Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; if a virgin marries,
            she has not
            sinned those who have wives should live as if they had
            none; An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can
            please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- and his interests are
            divided.  An unmarried woman or virgin is
            concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both
            body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the
            affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.  If
            anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she
            is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants.
            He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter
            in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and
            who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right
            thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does
            right, but he who does not marry her does even better. A woman is bound to her husband
            as
            long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
            but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she
            stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. the head of every
            man is Christ the head of the woman is man Every man who
            prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who
            prays or prophesies
            with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were
            shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut
            off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she
            should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since
            he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For
            man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created
            for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels,
            the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.  woman is not independent
            of
            man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born
            of woman. Judge for
            yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does
            not the very nature of things
            teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman
            has long hair, it
            is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone
            wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches
            of God. v n="34"/&gt;As in
            all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.
            They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they
            want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at
            home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. I want men everywhere
            to lift up holy
            hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. I also want women to dress modestly,
            with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
            clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to
            worship God.  A woman should
            learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach
            or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then
            Eve.
            And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived
            and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if
            they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. Do not rebuke an older
            man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as
            brothers, older women as mothers, and younger
            women as sisters, with absolute purity. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
            children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
            Some have in fact already
            turned away to follow Satan.  If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family,
            she should help them and
            not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
            who are really in need.  I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
            present you as a pure virgin to him.  
            Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives
            and do not be
            harsh with them.  Fathers, do not
            embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Wives, submit to your husbands
            as to
            the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head
            of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church
            submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
            Husbands, love your wives,
            just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her
            holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to
            present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
            blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love
            their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no
            one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as
            Christ does the church-- for we are members of his body. "For
            this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and
            the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery--but I am
            talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must
            love his wife as he loves himself the wife must respect her husband. " Fathers, do
            not exasperate your children; instead,
            bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. male nor female Even their
            women exchanged natural relations
            for unnatural ones In the
            same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with
            lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in
            themselves the due penalty for their perversion. by law a married woman is bound to
            her husband as
            long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of
            marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still
            alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from
            that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man Teach the older
            men to be temperate, worthy of respect,
            self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.  Likewise, teach the
            older women to be
            reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
            to
            teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their
            husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home,
            to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word
            of God Similarly, encourage
            the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by
            doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and
            soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be
            ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
