                    served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely
                    tested by the plots of the Jews. <v n="20"/>You know that I have not hesitated
                    to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and
                    from house to house. <v n="21"/>I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that

                    will happen to me there. <v n="23"/>I only know that in every city the Holy
                    Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. <v n="24"/>However, I
                    consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete
                    the task the Lord Jesus has given me--the task of testifying to the gospel of
                    God's grace. <v n="25"/>"Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone

                    declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men. <v n="27"/>For
                    I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. <v n="28"/>Keep
                    watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you
                    overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own
                    blood. <v n="29"/>I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among
                    you and will not spare the flock. <v n="30"/>Even from your own number men will

                    before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
                        <v n="3"/>and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the
                    Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me
                    patiently. <v n="4"/>"The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a
                    child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
                        <v n="5"/>They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are
                    willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a
                    Pharisee. <v n="6"/>And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised
                    our fathers that I am on trial today. <v n="7"/>This is the promise our twelve
                    tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O
                    king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me. <v n="8"/>Why
                    should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? <v n="9"/>"I
                    too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of
                    Jesus of Nazareth. <v n="10"/>And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the
                    authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they
                    were put to death, I cast my vote against them. <v n="11"/>Many a time I went
                    from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them
                    to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to
                    persecute them. <v n="12"/>"On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus
                    with the authority and commission of the chief priests. <v n="13"/>About noon, O
                    king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun,
                    blazing around me and my companions. <v n="14"/>We all fell to the ground, and I
                    heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It
                    is hard for you to kick against the goads.' <v n="15"/>"Then I asked, 'Who are
                    you, Lord?' <v n="16"/>"'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord
                    replied. 'Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint
                    you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will
                    show you. <v n="17"/>I will rescue you from your own people and from the
                    Gentiles. I am sending you to them <v n="18"/>to open their eyes and turn them
                    from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may
                    receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith
                    in me.' <v n="19"/>"So then, <name ref="Agrippa">King Agrippa</name>, I was not
                    disobedient to the vision from heaven. <v n="20"/>First to those in Damascus,
                    then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I
                    preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by
                    their deeds. <v n="21"/>That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and
                    tried to kill me. <v n="22"/>But I have had God's help to this very day, and so
                    I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond
                    what the prophets and <name ref="Moses">Moses</name> said would happen-- <v
                        n="23"/>that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the
