                              kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, <v n="21"
                              />nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the
                              kingdom of God is within you." <v n="22"/>Then he said to his
                              disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the
                              days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. <v n="23"/>Men will
                              tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after
                              them. <v n="24"/>For the Son of Man in his day will be like the
                              lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the
                              other. <v n="25"/>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected
                              by this generation. <v n="26"/>"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so
                              also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. <v n="27"/>People were
                              eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day
                              Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. <v

                              and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. <v n="29"
                              />But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven
                              and destroyed them all. <v n="30"/>"It will be just like this on the
                              day the Son of Man is revealed. <v n="31"/>On that day no one who is
                              on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get
                              them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. <v

                              his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it. <v
                                    n="34"/>I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed;
                              one will be taken and the other left. <v n="35"/>Two women will be
