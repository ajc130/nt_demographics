                  <v n="1"/>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
                  was God. <v n="2"/>He was with God in the beginning. <v n="3"/>Through him all
                  things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <v n="4"/>In
                  him was life, and that life was the light of men. <v n="5"/>The light shines in
                  the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <v n="6"/><description

                  <v n="9"/>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
                        <v n="10"/>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him,
                  the world did not recognize him. <v n="11"/>He came to that which was his own, but
                  his own did not receive him. <v n="12"/>Yet to all who received him, to those who
                  believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <v n="13"

                  but born of God. <v n="14"/>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
                  We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father,

                              has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light

                              the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has
                              been done through God."</speech></conversation>

                              ref="Jesus" audience="crowd" genre="prophesy" tone="condemning"> "I
                              tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only
                              what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the
                              Son also does. <v n="20"/>For the Father loves the Son and shows him
                              all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater
                              things than these. <v n="21"/>For just as the Father raises the dead
                              and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased
                              to give it. <v n="22"/>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has
                              entrusted all judgment to the Son, <v n="23"/>that all may honor the
                              Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does
                              not honor the Father, who sent him. <v n="24"/>"I tell you the truth,
                              whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
                              and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <v

                              will live. <v n="26"/>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has
                              granted the Son to have life in himself. <v n="27"/>And he has given
                              him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <v n="28"/>"Do
                              not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their

                              is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a
                              service to God. <v n="3"/>They will do such things because they have
                              not known the Father or me. <v n="4"/>I have told you this, so that
                              when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not
                              tell you this at first because I was with you. <v n="5"/>"Now I am
                              going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you
                              going?' <v n="6"/>Because I have said these things, you are filled
                              with grief. <v n="7"/>But I tell you the truth: It is for your good
                              that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to
                              you; but if I go, I will send him to you. <v n="8"/>When he comes, he
                              will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and
                              judgment: <v n="9"/>in regard to sin, because men do not believe in
                              me; <v n="10"/>in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the
                              Father, where you can see me no longer; <v n="11"/>and in regard to
                              judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. <v

                              bear. <v n="13"/>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will
                              guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak
                              only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. <v
                                    n="14"/>He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine
                              and making it known to you. <v n="15"/>All that belongs to the Father
                              is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and
                              make it known to you. <v n="16"/>"In a little while you will see me no
