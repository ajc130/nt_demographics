                    is still to come. <v n="8"/>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against

                    Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the

                    those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has

                    give its light; <v n="25"/>the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly
                    bodies will be shaken.' <v n="26"/>"At that time men will see the Son of Man
                    coming in clouds with great power and glory. <v n="27"/>And he will send his
                    angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to
                    the ends of the heavens. <v n="28"/>"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As
                    soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is
                    near. <v n="29"/>Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it
                    is near, right at the door. <v n="30"/>I tell you the truth, this generation
                    will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <v n="31"
                    />Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.<v n="32"
                    />"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the
                    Son, but only the Father. <v n="33"/>Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when
                    that time will come. <v n="34"/>It's like a man going away: He leaves his house
                    and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one
                    at the door to keep watch. <v n="35"/>"Therefore keep watch because you do not
                    know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at
                    midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. <v n="36"/>If he comes
                    suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. <v n="37"/>What I say to you, I say
                    to everyone: 'Watch!'" </speech></monologue></story>
