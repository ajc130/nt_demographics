    <section><v n="4"/>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, <v n="5"/>because I
      hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. <v n="6"/>I pray
      that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of
      every good thing we have in Christ. <v n="7"/>Your love has given me great joy and
      encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. </section>
    <section><v n="8"/>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you
      ought to do, <v n="9"/>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as <name ref="Paul"

      he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. <v n="14"/>But I
      did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous
      and not forced. <v n="15"/>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was
      that you might have him back for good-- <v n="16"/>no longer as a slave, but better than a
      slave, as a dear brother. <description type="good" ref="Onesimus">He is very dear to me but
        even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</description>
      <v n="17"/>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. <v n="18"/>If
      he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. <v n="19"/>I, <name
        ref="Paul">Paul</name>, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention
      that you owe me your very self. <v n="20"/>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit
      from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. <v n="21"/>Confident of your obedience, I
      write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. <v n="22"/>And one thing more:
      Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
