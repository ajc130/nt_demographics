                <instruction>not to teach false doctrines any longer <v n="4"/>nor to devote
                    themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather
                    than God's work--which is by faith. <v n="5"/>The goal of this command is love,
                    which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. <v
                        n="6"/>Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk. <v

                    are talking about or what they so confidently affirm. <v n="8"/>We know that the
                    law is good if one uses it properly. <v n="9"/>We also know that law is made not
                    for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the
                    unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
                    murderers, <v n="10"/>for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars
                    and perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine <v n="11"

            a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in
            ignorance and unbelief. <v n="14"/>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me
            abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. <v n="15"/>Here is a
            trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to
            save sinners--of whom I am the worst. <v n="16"/>But for that very reason I was shown
            mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited
            patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life. <v

        <section><c n="3"/><v n="1"/>Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an
            overseer, he desires a noble task. <v n="2"/>Now the overseer must be above reproach,
                <es eg="women">the husband of but one wife</es>, temperate, self-controlled,
            respectable, hospitable, able to teach, <v n="3"/>not given to drunkenness, not violent
            but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. <v n="4"/>He must manage his own
            family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. <v n="5"/>(If anyone
            does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) <v
                n="6"/>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under
            the same judgment as the devil. <v n="7"/>He must also have a good reputation with
            outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap. <v n="8"
                /><es eg="women">Deacons, likewise, are to be men</es> worthy of respect, sincere,
            not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. <v n="9"/>They must keep
            hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. <v n="10"/>They must first
            be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. <v
                n="11"/>In the same way, <es eg="men">their wives are to be women worthy of
                respect</es>, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. <v
                n="12"/>A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children
            and his household well.<v n="13"/>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing
            and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. </section>
        <section><v n="14"/>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions
            so that, <v n="15"/>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct
            themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and
            foundation of the truth. <v n="16"/>Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is
            great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was
            preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory. <c
                n="4"/>
            <v n="1"/>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and
            follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <v n="2"/>Such teachings come
            through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. <v
                n="3"/>They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods,
            which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the
            truth. <v n="4"/>For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it
            is received with thanksgiving, <v n="5"/>because it is consecrated by the word of God
            and prayer. <v n="6"/>If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good
            minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching
            that you have followed. <v n="7"/>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives'
            tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. <v n="8"/>For physical training is of some
            value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life
            and the life to come. <v n="9"/>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full
            acceptance <v n="10"/>(and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in
            the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. <v
                n="11"/>Command and teach these things. <v n="12"/>Don't let anyone look down on you
            because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love,
            in faith and in purity. <v n="13"/>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading
            of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. <v n="14"/>Do not neglect your gift, which
            was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on
            you. <v n="15"/>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that
            everyone may see your progress. <v n="16"/>Watch your life and doctrine closely.
            Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers. </section>
        
        <section><c n="5"/><gsi gender="male" tone="instructive"><v n="1"/>Do not rebuke an older man harshly,
                but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,</gsi>
            <gsi gender="female" tone="instructive"><v n="2"/>older women as mothers, and younger

                need.</es>
            <v n="4"/>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all
            to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their
            parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. <v n="5"/>The widow who is really
            in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and
            to ask God for help. <v n="6"/>But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while
            she lives. <v n="7"/>Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open
            to blame. <v n="8"/>If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his
            immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. <v n="9"/>No
            widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to
            her husband, <v n="10"/>and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up
            children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble
            and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. <v n="11"/>As for younger widows, do
            not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to
            Christ, they want to marry. <v n="12"/>Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because
            they have broken their first pledge. <v n="13"/>Besides, they get into the habit of
            being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but
            also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. <gsi gender="female"
                tone="instructive"><v n="14"/>So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have
                children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
                </gsi><gsi gender="female" tone="condemning"><v n="15"/>Some have in fact already
                turned away to follow Satan. </gsi><gsi gender="female" tone="instructive"><v n="16"
                />If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and
                not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows
                who are really in need.</gsi>
            <v n="17"/>The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double
            honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <v n="18"/>For the
            Scripture says, "Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain," and "The
            worker deserves his wages." <v n="19"/>Do not entertain an accusation against an elder
            unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. <v n="20"/>Those who sin are to be
            rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning. <v n="21"/>I charge you, in the
            sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without
            partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. <v n="22"/>Do not be hasty in the
            laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. <v
                n="23"/>Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and
            your frequent illnesses. <v n="24"/>The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place
            of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <v n="25"/>In the same
            way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden. <c n="6"/>
            <csi class="slave" tone="instructive"><v n="1"/>All who are under the yoke of slavery
                should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God's name and our
                teaching may not be slandered. <v n="2"/>Those who have believing masters are not to
                show less respect for them because they are brothers. Instead, they are to serve
                them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers, and
                dear to them.</csi></section>
